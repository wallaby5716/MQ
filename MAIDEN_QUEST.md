one shot plot
=============
you are the Morgott's Guard of Gold. The elite of the elite of Leyndell. Soldiers among your ranks are chosen to join the Night's Cavalry. You're gathered and told of Mohg causing mischief in the sewers. 
In the sewers a gang of vulgar militia led by an omen or two stop you, blame the group for members of their gang going missing. in reality its Mohg and some revenants stealing away people from Leyndell and draining their blood in an attempt to amass enough red goo to bring back Mohg's love of his life: Miquella.

##### If you run past enemies, you take some percent of the damage you took the first time you fought them.

> Stone sword key that takes you to a fight with a revenant and then a grace before the final boss.

> One path leads to double lobster and esgar, then down a corridor to the old city and down to the boss. Before activating a lift down, there is a fanged imp door requiring a stonesword key to find a Revenant's hideout.
	
> Path leads to Volgar militia ambush and sewers
> Maybe they need a key for the old town section that is in this sewers or the opposite.

ambush room where there are ranged marrionettes shooting at them, and some small group they'll want to nuke
Maybe basilisks?

##### Roll!

* Burn an action this round and avoid all damage.

* When a character is incapacitated, their allies can revive them. To do so an ally needs to spend an action attacking you. They roll damage as usual.

* If you have already been incapacitated this combat, any incoming damage (healing) is halved.
